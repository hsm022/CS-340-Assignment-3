**CS340 Assignment 3**

**Topic: Heapsort**

# Description: 
I am choosing heapsort to implement in c++ programming language for part two of my thrid CS340 assignment. There is only one file of this project. 

**heapsort.cpp**
This file contains the source code of the heapsort. It prompts the user to enter the total number of numbers he/she will be entering. Once user provides a number the program creates a dynamic array and asks the user to provide the inputs. Once all the inputs are entered, the program generates a max-heap and starts sorting the array. Once the array is sorted it is printed on the screen.

**Reference**
headsort.cpp is a modified version of heapsort code from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/.
